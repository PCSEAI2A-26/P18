Malware Detection using Machine Learning

Overview:
This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for malware detection. The goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate system that can identify malicious software using advanced algorithms and techniques.

Introduction:
Malware poses a significant threat to computer systems, and traditional signature-based  detection methods may not be sufficient to detect new and evolving threats. This project leverages machine learning to build a more adaptive and effective malware detection system which detects pe header files.

Dependencies
Python 
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn

Usage:
Data Preprocessing: Prepare your dataset .
Dataset:For this project, we are using a  malware dataset from kaggle. 
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset .
Model Training:
The model is trained using a machine learning algorithms . 
Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy. Adjust the model and features as needed to improve results.
